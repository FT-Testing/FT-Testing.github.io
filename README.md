### What Am I?
Real-time bus tracking test site for [Freedom Transit's Bus Service](https://www.freedom-transit.org/default.htm).


### How Do I Work?
I use Google's [Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to draw a map with marked bus locations.

Busses are equipped with tablets that, when running the Tracker app, send their location data to 
Firebase at scheduled intervals.


### Who Created Me?
I was built by a team of students at [Washington & Jefferson College](http://www.washjeff.edu/).
